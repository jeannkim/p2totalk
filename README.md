# PRESS P2 to TALK
Fansite of the webseries [Petscop](https://www.youtube.com/c/Petscop) that lets you speak in its [Gamepad language](https://petscop.fandom.com/wiki/Gamepad_language).

> The gamepad language, or P2 to TALK, is a form of communication inside Petscop that uses a second controller connected to the PlayStation to communicate using a phonetics-based system.

> The PlayStation controller buttons have set combinations that refer to a phoneme. These phonetic combinations refer to a dictionary table that output words that have the given phonetics. Errors in input (including words not in the dictionary table) will result in a "Not In Table" message.

## Keybinds
