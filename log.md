> i am in turmoil. may Petscop anchor me to the earth

rough process:
- translate keypresses to Button presses (webstuff; later)
- translate button press combinations into phonemes 
- translate phoneme combinations into words

**step 2: the button presses to the phonemes**

define variables for different button presses
- booleans? can edit later
- [keydown](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key)
- [more keydown with js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InKP-eRx6ts)


- i should just make a file on my local computer that deals with this


How do I map two-ish inputs to an equivalent phoneme?
